# Air Pollution Data Visualization using Power BI and Excel

Understanding air quality trends is crucial for public health and environmental policies. This project leverages Power BI and Excel to visualize and analyze Air Quality Index (AQI) data across various Indian cities, providing insights into pollution patterns over time.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Air Quality Data in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india).

### Columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **City** | Name of the city in India |
| **Date** | Date of the recorded measurement |
| **PM2.5** | Concentration of particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller |
| **PM10** | Concentration of particulate matter 10 micrometers or smaller |
| **NO** | Nitric oxide concentration |
| **NO2** | Nitrogen dioxide concentration |
| **NOx** | Nitrogen oxides concentration |
| **NH3** | Ammonia concentration |
| **CO** | Carbon monoxide concentration |
| **SO2** | Sulfur dioxide concentration |
